# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project contains one R script, `run_analysis.R`, which: 

* Load the various files which make-up the UCI dataset
* Merges the three `test` and three `train` files into a single data table, setting textual columns heading where possible
* Computes the means of mean and std variables, grouped by subject and activity.
* Saves this last dataset to `./tidyset.txt`.

Once executed, the resulting dataset maybe found at `./tidyset.txt`
